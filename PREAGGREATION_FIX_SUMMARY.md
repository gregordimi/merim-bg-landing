# Pre-Aggregation Fix Summary

## What I've Done

### 1. ‚úÖ Updated `model/prices.js`
Added **exact match pre-aggregations** for your chart queries:

```javascript
// EXACT match for retailer chart query
retailer_chart_match: {
  measures: [averageRetailPrice],
  dimensions: [retailers.name],
  timeDimension: price_date,
  granularity: 'day',
  refreshKey: {every: '4 hours'}
},

// EXACT match for category chart query  
category_chart_match: {
  measures: [averageRetailPrice],
  dimensions: [category_groups.name],
  timeDimension: price_date,
  granularity: 'day',
  refreshKey: {every: '4 hours'}
}
```

### 2. ‚úÖ Added Fast Additive Alternatives
```javascript
// Fast retailer aggregation using additive measures
retailer_additive: {
  measures: [totalRetailPrice, retailPriceCount],
  dimensions: [retailers.name],
  timeDimension: price_date,
  granularity: 'day',
  refreshKey: {every: '4 hours'}
}
```

### 3. ‚úÖ Created Debug Tools
- `src/utils/cube/debugPreAggregations.ts` - Query analysis utility
- `src/components/debug/PreAggregationTest.tsx` - Test component
- Updated QueryRenderer with debugging

### 4. ‚úÖ Added Fast Chart Configs
- `retailer_fast` and `category_fast` in `chartConfigs.ts`
- Use additive measures for better performance

## What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Deploy the Updated Schema
1. Deploy your updated `model/prices.js` to your Cube.js server
2. Wait for pre-aggregations to build (check Cube.js logs)

### Step 2: Test Pre-Aggregation Matching
1. Go to your ChartListPage
2. Click on "üß™ Pre-Aggregation Test" 
3. Test each query type and check execution times:
   - **< 500ms** = Using pre-aggregations ‚úÖ
   - **> 2s** = Not using pre-aggregations ‚ùå

### Step 3: Switch to Fast Versions (Optional)
If you want even better performance:

```typescript
// In your chart components, use the fast versions:
import { CHART_CONFIGS } from "@/utils/cube/chartConfigs";

// Instead of:
const query = CHART_CONFIGS.retailer.query;

// Use:
const query = CHART_CONFIGS.retailer_fast.query;

// Then calculate average in frontend:
const average = totalRetailPrice / retailPriceCount;
```

## Expected Results

### Before (Current State)
- Query time: 2-10 seconds
- Uses source database every time
- Poor user experience

### After (With Pre-Aggregations)
- Query time: 100-500ms
- Uses pre-aggregated data
- Fast, responsive charts

## Troubleshooting

### If Queries Still Don't Match
1. Check Cube.js server logs for pre-aggregation build status
2. Use the debug test component to verify matching
3. Ensure exact dimension/measure names match between query and pre-aggregation

### Common Issues
- **Time zone mismatches**: Ensure consistent UTC usage
- **Granularity mismatches**: Query and pre-agg must have same granularity
- **Missing dimensions**: All filtered dimensions must be included in pre-aggregation

## Key Insights from Cube.js Docs

1. **Non-additive measures** (like `avg`) are harder to match with pre-aggregations
2. **Exact matching** is required - ALL dimensions and measures must match
3. **Additive measures** (like `sum`, `count`) provide better pre-aggregation performance
4. **Time dimension granularity** must match exactly between query and pre-aggregation

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the updated schema
2. Test with the debug component
3. Monitor performance improvements
4. Consider switching to additive measures for maximum speed
